This is a fully functioning hashmap. It is written in assembly x86 programming language. It references the irvine library. 

Typical implementation. The program executes a hash function which in turn references a memory address inside bucket. 
It utilizes the heap to store hashmap items. Creates an initial bucket of variable bucketSize that store that number of memory addresses pointing hasmap items. 
Then uses a linked list structure to reference any hash collisions 

Hashmap has 4 options demonstrated in screenshot below. 
Insert a key value pair
Delete a key value pair
Find a key value pair
Print everything 
Exit program

Only file uploaded is the main asm file. Run it with visual studio code
